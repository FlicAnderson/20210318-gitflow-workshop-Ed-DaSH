Materials for short git workshop for Ed-DaSH project meeting Thursday 18th March 2021.

Much of this workshop code is based on [code](https://bit.ly/wallace-lab-git) for a previous workshop put together by me ([@FlicAnderson](https://github.com/FlicAnderson)) & Sam Haynes ([@DimmestP](https://github.com/DimmestP)) for members of the [Wallace Lab](https://ewallace.github.io/) at the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences.
