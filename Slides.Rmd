This is a `.html` presentation created in `R Markdown` with `ioslides`. 

(It's been written in a [.Rmd](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file, and we generated .html slides by 'knitting' it in Rstudio.)

You can check out the code used to make these slides at the [Workshop repo](https://github.com/FlicAnderson/20210318-gitflow-workshop-Ed-DaSH) on Github, and adapt it for your own presentations if you like - I've got a MIT Licence on the repo, which means:

# Intro:

## Git

**Git** is a *version control system*. 

* It doesn't copy your files, as much as keep track of all `changes` ever since you told git to `add` the file to its logs
* Best for `text` files; can't see 'into' binaries (e.g. pdfs, pics)
* Saves the changes you tell it to `commit` to its log in project-specific folders referred to as a repository, or `repo`
* Very useful: undo/redo, backups, switching computers, safely 'experimenting'

It can be used via *Command Line* (the terminal!) or via a *Graphical User Interface* (GUI), on pretty much all systems.

## GitHub

**GitHub** is an *online platform* for storing your git repository. There are others (e.g. GitLab, Bitbucket).

* Keep track of all your repos online - `public` or `private`
* You can tell git to `push` its list of your file changes up to GitHub.
* Or `pull` changes down (yours or someone else's!) and `merge` them with your local copies. 
* Contribute to others' work via a `pull request`

## Git Workflow

<div class="centered">
```{r, out.width = "650"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M_fHUEqA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/128hsgntnsu9bww0y8sz.png")
``` 
</div>

## How To Write A Good Commit Message

`git commit -m "..."`

Be consise & consistent!

* WHAT did you do (e.g. fix, rework, add, update)
* WHERE (e.g. filename, function name, section of paper, variable)

`git commit -m "add resources section to 'README.md'"`

# Issue Tickets 

## Issue Tickets 

* GitHub tool: create 'issues' within a repo, where you can add notes.
* markdown format - can include code snippets, formatting, links, emojis!
* @-tag in other GitHub users ("@FlicAnderson, do you get this 404 error before?")
* assign labels to issues like "help wanted", "bug", "question". 
* link issues with pull requests, or keep them separate. 
* once the issue is solved, you can mark it as closed!

## How To Write A Good Issue Ticket

*Give a clear and concise description of the problem or new feature to help others get up to speed quickly*

* how you found the issue & what you've done already to try fix/investigate it/ideas
* tag in colleagues who might offer insights, or answer any questions
* remember to update the issue regularly as progress happens!  
* link to other issues in that repo using the hashtag & issue number e.g. `#42`
* add Add the most useful labels / create your own
* check with people before randomly assigning them issues! :)

## Branching

<div class="centered">
```{r, out.width = "700"}

```

## Branching

The concept of branching is a combination of good coding practice and good project management. 

It consists of separating projects into larger objectives and smaller, manageable tasks. 

It also enables you to prototype changes in isolation, minimising risk, and provides checkpoints to quickly return to when things do go wrong.

## Branching | Long vs short

<b> Long Branch </b>

Long branches can exist for months or are even permanent features of a repo. 

They can be merged into the main branch multiple times, possibly containing updates on thousands of lines of code. 

They are used to isolate large tasks or allow for gate-keeping for projects with continuous updates.

Examples: Staging branch, prototyping branch, software release branch, manuscript chapter branch

## Branching | Long vs short

<b> Short (or Topic) Branch </b>

Short branches exist for hours or weeks, they may consist of only one commit. 

Once merged with the main branch or a long branch they are deleted. 

They enclose small changes in code and separate long term goals into short term tasks.

Examples: issue branch, function branch, figure branch, documentation branch

## Branching | Commits vs branches

Commits are checkpoints for sub-tasks, often no more than 10 lines of code. 

Topic branches are checkpoints for tasks, with one or more commit.

```{bash eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
git checkout -b quality_control

git add check_microarray_data.R

git commit -m "function to create
tibble from microarray data"

git commit -am "ggplot functions to display raw data"
```

## Branching | Where am I?

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.watch-out {
  background-color: lightgreen;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: white;
}
```

```{bash eval=FALSE, echo =TRUE}
git branch
```
```{bash eval=FALSE, echo =TRUE, class.source = "watch-out"}
  master 
```
```{bash eval=FALSE, echo =TRUE}
git branch -a
```
```{bash eval=FALSE, echo =TRUE, class.source = "watch-out"}
  master
  remotes/upstream/master
  remotes/upstream/staging
```

## Branching | Local vs remote

GitHub is an amazing collaborative tool, but significantly complicates code management.

Branches and commits will appear on the remote repo that are not on your local repo (and vice versa)

This multiplies again if you originally forked from someone else!

## Branching | Tips for code hygiene

- Don't commit unfinished code and merge incomplete branches

- Update your main branch everyday (typically using git rebase)

- Keep topic branches short and merge-delete often!

- Ensure commits are made in relevant branches

# Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting | Stashing

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
git stash [push]
```

Reverts the code back to the last commit and saves changes in temp file.

Perfect for when you realise you're working in the wrong branch.

Swap to right branch and pop the changes back

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
git checkout other_branch
git stash pop
```

## Troubleshooting | Reverting and cherrypicking

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
git revert e8cc44d3ce4b01fb2d211bffec0c69cbaa0d80f4
```

Eventually you will accidentally commit a bug into your branch and need to remove it.

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
git cherry-pick e8cc44d3ce4b01fb2d211bffec0c69cbaa0d80f4
```

Some cases my require you to select exactly which commits to merge (rather than a whole branch)
